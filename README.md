## Description
A responsive SPA portfolio with a simple UI showcasing my work. It was built using the React framework and I had a lot of fun making it. See the "About" section to get to know me. Check out the "Projects" section to see my highlighted works. The "Resume" section is what you would expect, and the "Contact" section will allow users to send me an email directly. I plan on integrating Nodemailer to handle this in the future. For now see the resume section for my contact info or select the email icon in the footer. The languages, technologies, and frameworks used to build this application are: React, JavaScript, ES6, Chakra UI, & Tailwind CSS.
