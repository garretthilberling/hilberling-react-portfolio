## Description
A SPA portfolio showing off the projects I have completed as a part of the UCF Bootcamp. It was built using the React framework and I had a lot of fun making it. See the 'About' section to get to know me. Check out the 'Projects' section to see my highlighted works. The 'Resume' section is what you would expect, and the 'Contact' section will allow users to send me an email directly. I plan on integrating Nodemailer to handle this in the future. For now see my resume for contact info. The languages, technologies, and frameworks used to build this application are: JavaScript, ES6, React, Chakra UI, & Tailwind CSS.
